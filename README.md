## Views
In the app, you add "views" to the page. A view is a panel that displays a graph,
table, or other data, as well as controls for interacting with the data. There are three
types of views. Data views display historical data in a graph or table from a given ticker symbol or
set of ticker symbols between two specified dates. Trading simulation views allow you to test an
investment strategy on historical data to see how it would have performed. Predictor views
display investment recommendations based on common market indicators (such as volatility and trends),
as well as the indicators themselves.
